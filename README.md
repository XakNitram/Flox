# Flox
Flocking simulation written with pyglet and OpenGL

This project serves as a test bed for concepts I pick up on my journey to learn graphics libraries, specifically OpenGL.

1. Drawing simple shapes
1. Shaders
1. Uniforms
1. Transforms
1. Shapes constructed of a variable number of smaller shapes
1. Batched rendering
1. Textures?

The project also serves to hone my skills with data structures and layouts.
1. Abstraction
1. Data-oriented design (to a small degree)
1. Quad-trees
